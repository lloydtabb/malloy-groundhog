            "description": "Concord Charlie is a presumed groundhog from Athens, West Virginia. In a tradition dating back to 1978, Charlie meets with the President of Concord University and relays his predictions regarding the duration of winter. The President then joins a slew of guests at the University’s annual Groundhog Day Breakfast and shares Charlie’s predictions. Notably, Charlie has never been seen by anyone except the President and presumably other university staff; we believe him to be a groundhog based on these few eyewitness accounts.",

Merv is a puppet — technically a golf club cover — which is a bonus, because he lives forever and doesn’t need to be awakened from hibernation for a prediction. Merv began his storied career as an actor in puppet shows, but has since evolved into a Manitoba legend with a near flawless prediction rate.",

The event was canceled in 2021 and 2022 due to the pandemic, but Sammi returned for a prediction in 2023. The prediction ritual starts with members of the lodge gathering around Sammi, and then giving a welcome, a prayer and a prediction in both English and Pennsylvania Dutch. When he is not the centre of attention on February 2nd, Sammi resides in the unbelievably-named community of Kunkletown.",

Instead, Billy is more properly a Richardson Ground Squirrel (ie, a gopher) who lives in a man-sized burrow outside the Blue Grass Nursery & Garden Centre. Billy eats seeds, leaves, roots and flowers, as well as some insects, and of course his annual Groundhog Day Breakfast!",

Jack Galbraith (pictured) started the event in 2007, remarking that weather predictions in faraway Punxatawney aren’t typically accurate in Ontario. Mike’s family grew over the years: in 2008 he met Melbourne Minnie, and in the following years they were blessed with children and friends: Little Wolfe, Maple, Leaf, Alby, and Bobby Jo. JoAnn Galbraith (Jack’s wife) carries on the now-famous tradition with the local village to help pass the winter blues.",

And with great results: a prior Burrow Master said Doug “has been making predictions for about 30 years and has always been 100 percent accurate.”",

Unlike the traditional ‘shadow’ method preferred by landgoing prognosticators, Benny’s prediction is based on his breakfast. “I pour a bunch of minnows into this big tank with a live bass,” says Mike Fornataro, Chair of Winterfest, “Then people chant, Take the bait, spring can’t wait.’ The bass has three minutes to eat a minnow. If he does, it’s an early spring. If he doesn’t, it’s six more weeks of winter.”",

Casimir — aka, The Polish Prince of Felines — was found abandoned as a kitten on the footsteps of Cleveland’s St. Casimir Polish Church in 2012. Master of Ceremonies John Niedzialek interprets Casimir’s forecast based on the way he eats his yearly pierogis. If he eats them sloppily, Cleveland is in for a long, messy spring; if Casimir eats them normally, then it’s winter as usual; and if he swallows the pierogis in one gulp, the region can look forward to a warm coming summer. Since Casimir’s predictions are a little unconventional, we try our best to fit them into the “spring/winter” dichotomy we prefer on GROUNDHOG-DAY.com.",
